Preferred project type for this one - 'Windows Forms'

NOTE: In case of need to migrate to another one project type,
the only one place in code, where specific to 'Windows Forms' code is used
is in Program.cs::Program::Wait where 'Application.DoEvents()' is called.
It can be replaced with analogue, that suspends termination of program.
